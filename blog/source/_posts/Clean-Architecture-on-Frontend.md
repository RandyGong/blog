Does the front end have an architecture? This may be the confusion of many people, because in actual business development, we rarely design standard code architecture for the front end, and may pay more attention to engineering, directory level, and the implementation of business code.

Today, let's look at a front-end architecture model. The original author called it "clean architecture". The article is very long and detailed. I spent a long time reading it, and it was very rewarding. I also incorporated a lot of my own thinking into the article. I recommend you to read it.
